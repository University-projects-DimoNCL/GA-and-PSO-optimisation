The description of the algorithms is minimal and reflects lack of understanding.
The tuning process is well explained and thorough.However, for the baseline of scenario 2 it would have been better to balance iterations and popsize to 100-100 rather than 10-1000.
What you call step 3 of tuning seems a bit trial and error and could be more systematic.
The results are generally well presented, but the final comparison could be more detailed.
The report makes good use of figures and tables of results.
