THis is Dimo Dimchev's submission of CSC3423 coursework.

In \Genetic Algorithms\CW1\src you will find the classes I used to do my optimisation.

In \Genetic Algorithms\CW1 you will find :

 1.My report, which is called CSC3423_CW1_Report.
 2.Two python scripts that I wrote to draw figures - plotGA and plotPSO.
 3.PSO.config + GA.config that I use in java to tune the algorithms.
 4.Some of the figures generated by the python scripts.

In E:\Genetic Algorithms\CW1\Figures you will find :

 The .csv and Figures used in my report that I generated with the plotGA and plotPSO python scripts.
 The .csv files were generated with filewriter in java(code is commented so it will not work if you just run it.)

		PSO:
	   
Scenario 1:neighWeight-2.25,inertiaWeight-1.25,personalWeight-1.0,Global Weight-1.0,maxMinVelocity- 0.0000001,numIters-10000,numParticles-100,  best fitness- 5.179856543691131E-13
Scenario 2:neighWeight-1.9,inertiaWeight-1.0,personalWeight-1.0,Global Weight-1.0,maxMinVelocity- 0.00000000000001 ,numIters-100, numParticles-100,  best fitness- 9.00


	
		GA:
	   
For the results below for mutation I used the GuasianMutator operator and for crossover I used Mean Alterer.

Scenario 1:popSize-100,numSurvivors-1,tournamentSize-2,probMutation-0.05,probCrossover-0.45,numIters-10000,  best fitness- 0.00009
Scenario 2:popSize-1000,numSurvivors-1,tournamentSize-2,probMutation-0.04,probCrossover-0.95,numIters-10,  best fitness- 4.73
