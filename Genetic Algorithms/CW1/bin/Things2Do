1.For each value change run the algorithm 30 times	
2.Average the Best fit from the 30 runs and this gives us the average bestFit for the changed value
3.Do this for every single value increasing/decreasing the value sistematically
4.Draw a graph with these values
5.What is the conclusion from the values?
6.After Doing this for every single value, combine them with each other and see  what happens
7.Conclusion again
